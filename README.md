# RLRPG

Little C++17 console-based rogue-like RPG inspired by Nethack and Angband.

# Build

You need ```cmake``` and ```make``` utilities to build the game. Then just execute:
```
cmake . && make
```
Unfortunately, there is no standard way to install the game now. Files needed to run the game are tips.txt and the
binary itself, RLRPG file.
